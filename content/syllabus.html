<h3 id="course-objectives">Course objectives</h3>
<p><span class="newthought">By the end of this course,</span> you will (1) be data literate and (2) be able to answer your own questions with statistical and data scientific tools.</p>
<p>Specifically, you’ll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be curious and confident with data</li>
<li>Feel comfortable with R</li>
<li>Tidy and wrangle data imperturbably</li>
<li>Find patterns in data with appropriate graphs and visualizations</li>
<li>Pose and test insightful hypotheses</li>
<li>Accurately interpret results from basic inferential statistical analyses</li>
<li>Understand the assumptions and limitations of statistical procedures</li>
<li>Communicate the results of your analyses in accessible language</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these objectives, this course fulfills three of the four learning outcomes for University of Utah’s <a href="https://mpa.utah.edu/">Master of Public Administration (MPA)</a> and <a href="https://mpp.utah.edu/">Master of Public Policy</a> program. It can also be used as credit for Ph.D. students for their advanced quantitative analysis course (i.e. POLS 6002).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantitative Analysis</strong>: Our MPP and MPA graduates are skilled at evaluating programs and policies. They know how to gather data, correctly analyze it, and employ the analysis to recommend policy and programmatic action in public service organizations.</li>
<li><strong>Public Service Values</strong>: Our MPA and MPP graduates demonstrate an understanding of, passion for, and commitment to public service values, including reverence for the dignity and worth of all people and dedication to ethical governance.</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong>: Our MPA and MPP graduates effectively convey verbal and written information with the polish and professionalism appropriate for the public service context. They listen to and promote understanding among people with diverse viewpoints.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="course-philosophy">Course philosophy</h3>
<p><span class="newthought">Classical statistics classes</span> spend substantial time covering probability theory, null hypothesis testing, and other statistical tests first developed hundreds of years ago. Some classes don’t use software or actual real data and instead live in the world of mathematical proofs. They can be math-heavy and full of often un-intuitive concepts and equations.</p>
<p>In this class, we will take the opposite approach. We <em>begin</em> with data and learn how to tidy, wrangle, manipulate, and visualize it with code. Later in the semester we turn to more classical topics like inference and statistical modeling, but continue to keep the focus on data as we do so.</p>
<p>In other words, there’s way less of this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}
\]</span></p>
<p>And way more of this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>summary_monthly_temp <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> weather <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> </span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">group_by</span>(month) <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> </span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">summarize</span>(<span class="at">mean =</span> <span class="fu">mean</span>(temp), </span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>            <span class="at">std_dev =</span> <span class="fu">sd</span>(temp))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Over the last decade there has been a revolution in statistical and scientific computing. Open source languages like R and Python have overtaken older (and expensive!) corporate software packages like SAS and SPSS, and there are now thousands of books and blog posts and other online resources with excellent tutorials about how to analyze pretty much any kind of data.</p>
<p>This class will expose you to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>—one of the most popular, sought-after, and in-demand statistical programming languages. Armed with the foundation of R skills you’ll learn in this class, you’ll know enough to be able to find how to analyze any sort of data-based question in the future.</p>
<h3 id="course-materials">Course materials</h3>
<p><span class="newthought">There are no formal physical textbooks for the class.</span> We will only use (free!) online resources.</p>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="https://moderndive.com/"><strong>ModernDive</strong></a>: ModernDive will be our primary textbook. Please take the time to read the assigned chapters in depth and complete the Learning Checks when possible.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/"><strong>R for Data Science</strong></a>: Some of your readings will also come from the free R for Data Science book. Please take the time to read this book carefully as well and walk through the examples in RStudio.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> <a href="https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os"><strong>OpenIntro Statistics</strong></a>: A few of your readings will also come from the free OpenIntro Statistics book.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There will also occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the reading page for that week.</p>
<p>I also highly recommend subscribing to the <a href="https://rweekly.org/">R Weekly newsletter</a>. This e-mail is sent every Monday and is full of helpful tutorials about how to do stuff with R.</p>
<h4 id="r-and-rstudio">R and RStudio</h4>
<p>You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>. You will use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.</p>
<p>R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free <a href="http://rstudio.cloud/">RStudio.cloud</a> service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.</p>
<p>RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets or more complicated analysis. Over the course of the semester, you’ll probably want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud. This isn’t necessary, but it’s helpful.</p>
<p>You can <a href="/install/">find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.</a></p>
<h4 id="online-help-and-gitter">Online help and Gitter</h4>
<p>Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of headache (even if you’ve been doing this stuff for years!).</p>
<p>Fortunately there are tons of online resources to help you with this. Two of the most important are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> (a Q&amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/">RStudio Community</a> (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)).</p>
<p>Additionally, we have a class chatroom at <a href="https://gitter.im/byustatsf18/">Gitter</a> where anyone in the class can ask questions and anyone can answer. Ask questions about the readings, Learning Checks, lectures, or problem sets <a href="https://gitter.im/MPA-MPP-Stats/community">in the class Gitter</a>. I will monitor the chatroom regularly, and you should also all do so as well. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too.</p>
<h3 id="course-policies">Course policies</h3>
<p><span class="newthought">Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat.</span></p>
<p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In addition, if any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements for you. The following resources and statements are drawn directly from the University of Utah guidelines. If you have questions or concerns not answered below, please contact me directly so we can work together to answer and address them.</p>
<p>We will also follow the <a href="https://regulations.utah.edu/general/index.php">full list of college and university policies</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>Accommodation of Sincerely Held Beliefs</em>: I will work with students who require schedule changes due to religious or other significant obligations. I will not consider any requests based on course content. No other area of study touches on more sensitive topics than the broad category of “public policy” (and at times disturbing forms of human misbehavior such as criminal law). Policy researchers must read about, talk about, and listen to information relating to very difficult subjects. Sometimes case descriptions can be quite graphic. Students are required to attend all classes and to read all the assignments. All assignments and lectures are related to our subject matter.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Americans with Disabilities Act</em>. The University of Utah seeks to provide equal access to its programs, services, and activities for people with disabilities. If you will need accommodations in this class, reasonable prior notice needs to be given to the <a href="https://disability.utah.edu/">Center for Disability Services</a>, 162 Olpin Union Building, (801) 581-5020. CDS will work with you and the instructor to make arrangements for accommodations. All written information in this course can be made available in an alternative format with prior notification to the Center for Disability Services.</p></li>
<li><p><em>University Safety Statement</em>. The University of Utah values the safety of all campus community members. To report suspicious activity, call campus police at 801-585-COPS (801-585-2677). You will receive important emergency alerts and safety messages regarding campus safety via text message. For more information regarding safety and to view available training resources, including helpful videos, visit safeu.utah.edu.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Addressing Sexual Misconduct</em>. Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender (which Includes sexual orientation and gender identity/expression) is a civil rights offense subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race, national origin, color, religion, age, status as a person with a disability, veteran’s status or genetic information. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you are encouraged to report it to the Title IX Coordinator in the Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action, 135 Park Building, 801-581-8365, or the Office of the Dean of Students, 270 Union Building, 801-581-7066. For support and confidential consultation, contact the Center for Student Wellness, 426 SSB, 801-581-7776. To report to the police, contact the Department of Public Safety, 801-585-2677(COPS).</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="class-conduct-and-expectations">Class conduct and expectations</h4>
<p>On the first day of class, we came up a few specific rules, expectations, and policies for the course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Late work will be penalized by 10% each week it is late (starting the day after it is due)</li>
<li>If you miss a reading quiz, that’s fine—let me know and I can reopen it for you without penalty</li>
<li>Be responsible with laptop use.</li>
<li>Be good and respectful. You’re all adults.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="laptops">Laptops</h4>
<p>This is a computer-heavy course and each class session will require extensive laptop use. Use your computer responsibly in class.</p>
<h4 id="teams">Teams</h4>
<p>This class is team-based. In-class activities will be done largely in teams. Your problem sets will be turned in individually, but you can (and should!) work on them together in your assigned teams. Your final project will be completed and turned in as a team.</p>
<p>Please follow all the best practices you learned in Organizational Behavior to ensure that your team works well and that there is no free riding.</p>
