library(lubridate)  # Load date-related functions

# Load raw data
bird_strikes_raw <- read_csv("data/Birdstrikes_At_Salt_Lake_City_Intl_Airport_2000-2014.csv")

# Clean up the raw data a little
bird_strikes <- bird_strikes_raw %>% 
  mutate(Date = mdy_hms(Date)) %>% 
  mutate(Year = year(Date),
         Month = month(Date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) %>% 
  # Make these column names shorter
  rename(Phase = `Phase of Flight`,
         Cloudy = `Sky Condition`,
         Time = `Time of Day`,
         Cost = `Cost of Repairs`)
