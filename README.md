# PUBPL 6002: Public Management, Data Science, and R

## Intent

This is a class under development, using materials and design from [Andrew Heiss](), who first taught this course at our much beloved and nearby cousin BYU. 

## Theme

This site uses [Andrew Heiss' custom `ath-tufte-hugo_18-19` theme](https://github.com/andrewheiss/ath-tufte-hugo_18-19) as a submodule.

When cloning for the first time, use this command to get the theme too:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/andrewheiss/ath-tufte-hugo_18-19.git

To get the theme later, use this command:

    git submodule add \
      https://github.com/andrewheiss/ath-tufte-hugo_18-19.git \
      themes/ath-tufte-hugo_18-19

To update to the latest version of the theme, use:

    git submodule update --recursive --remote
